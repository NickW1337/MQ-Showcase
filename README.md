### What is Mere Questions?
Mere Questions is a simple Q&A platform. I made this with a few niche communities in mind that need a private Q&A space. Some features include: anonymous questions, single-use join codes, multi-use join codes, and enforceable question limits.

### Tools Used

#### Next.JS
This is the first React framework I have worked with. I really like it so far.

#### Stripe
I used Stripe to handle subscriptions and payments.

#### MongoDB
I chose MongoDB for this project as it has an easy learning curve, and it is the first database software I have worked with.

#### Auth.js
Auth.js was the obvious choice for authentication. It is FOSS and very easy to use with Next.js.

#### Jest
Testing is a must.

#### Tailwind
Makes writing CSS bearable!
